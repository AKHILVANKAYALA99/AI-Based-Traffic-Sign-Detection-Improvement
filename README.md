# AI-Based-Traffic-Sign-Detection-Improvement
##### Using Image Preprocessing and YOLOv-8
Traffic sign detection is crucial for road safety and navigation in both human-driven and autonomous vehicles.

It ensures adherence to traffic rules by identifying signs like speed limits, stop signs, and traffic signals, mitigating the risk of accidents essentially for autonomous vehicles.

It is essential for informed decision-making, enabling them to interpret and respond to traffic signs by generating alerts and warnings enhancing overall safety on the roads.

But enhancements are crucial to address these challenges for robust performance in diverse and unpredictable environments like -

1.Low Light Conditions

2.Variable Weather Conditions 

3.Rainfall Conditions

The Proposed Solution using YOLOv-8 involves Continuous monitoring of the Road  which uses the following steps.
* Capturing Video using sensors or a camera. 
* Converting Video into Continuous image frames.
* Allowing the Trained YOLOv-8 Model to Detect the Signs.
* Classifying the Sign present in the detected region.
* Decision making according to the Classified Sign.

Dataset - It had been collected from Different websites like kaggle and also used AI for generating images in different scenarios.
